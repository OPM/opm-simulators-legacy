    /// \brief Get a vector of pressure thresholds from EclipseState.
    /// This function looks at EQLOPTS, THPRES and EQLNUM to determine
    /// pressure thresholds.  It does not consider the case where the
    /// threshold values are defaulted, in which case they should be
    /// determined from the initial, equilibrated simulation state.
    /// \tparam    Grid           Type of grid object (UnstructuredGrid or CpGrid).
    /// \param[in] deck           Input deck, EQLOPTS and THPRES are accessed from it.
    /// \param[in] eclipseState   Processed eclipse state, EQLNUM is accessed from it.
    /// \param[in] grid           The grid to which the thresholds apply.
    /// \return                   A vector of pressure thresholds, one
    ///                           for each face in the grid. A value
    ///                           of zero means no threshold for that
    ///                           particular face. An empty vector is
    ///                           returned if there is no THPRES
